title: Interview Questions
---

I recently had my first "real interview" in years, and bombed it appropriately.
While I go off and review my understanding of algorithmic complexity, I leave
you, dear reader, with the list of questions I was asked:

1. Describe a complex project you worked on.

    Unlike during previous interviews in which I had been asked this question, I
    actually recalled a suitable project to talk about. Unfortunately, I don't know
    that it was really all that complex, and I hadn't thought about it in so long
    that I couldn't offer a very detailed description.

    I think there is a deeper root cause to my inability to answer this question
    satisfactorily, however.
